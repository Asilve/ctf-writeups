## Crack the Gate 1 (Easy)
#### Description
We’re in the middle of an investigation. One of our persons of interest, ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal. We’ve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org. Unfortunately, we don’t know the password, and the usual guessing techniques haven’t worked. But something feels off... it’s almost like the developer left a secret way in. Can you figure it out?

#### Thought Process
I figured that there was some login information or a backdoor that could be found in the inspect elements section, so I started digging around the HTML.

#### Solution
As expected, a encoded string was in the HTML. I started doing common Ciphers, starting with Caesar Cipher and moving to ROT13, which turned out to be a success. It said there was a bypass if a request was sent with the header "X-Dev-Access" set to yes. So i sent a new request with that header, and the flag was given.

## Cookie Monster Secret Recipe (Easy)
#### Description
Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website. As an aspiring cookie detective, your mission is to uncover this delectable secret. Can you outsmart Cookie Monster and find the hidden recipe?

#### Thought Process
I assumed somewhere in the html may store some information. When that didn't show anything, I realised the CTF was going to be about cookies (based on the name).

#### Solution
I found the cookies section and one cookie was present. The value of this cookie looked like an encoded message, so I used base64 as my first decode option, and the flag was output after decoding.
